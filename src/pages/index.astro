    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a student at Purdue University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in security.
        I also completed a math minor. It was a <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/courses/coursepage?subject=MA&course=34100"> bad decision</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I was uber fortunate that a small company in Indianapolis by the name of <a href="https://www.expectedbehavior.com/">Expected Behavior</a> 
        gave me the opportunity to intern for them the summer after my freshman year of college when I had next to no experience. 
        I used Ruby on Rails to work on a project management system, <a href="https://projectburndown.com/">Burndown</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That summer, I also explored Downtown Indianapolis and met some really cool people through the 
        <a href="https://techpoint.org/xtern/">Xtern</a> internship program. I can definitively say that I know
        Indy better than San Francisco, San Jose, or any of the other big cities in the Bay Area now. My friends back 
        home in California are less than thrilled. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also conducted research under Professor Aravind Machiry and the <a href="https://purs3lab.github.io/">PurS3 Lab</a> through 
        the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/VIP">Purdue VIP </a> program. 
        Our team did static analysis on hundreds of popular GitHub repositories to check for secure practices in GitHub Actions workflows. Check out our 
        <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-jGH0cVha1woyG4Rv-rdEi80VoIiG_iekzTXH2nV_A/edit?usp=sharing">final report</a> and 
        <a href = "https://github.com/purs3lab/POSSE-secure-workflows">GitHub repository</a>.
    </p> 
    <p>
        This summer, I am in sunny Los Angeles (Little Tokyo) working for <a href = "https://www.secondspectrum.com/index.html">Second Spectrum's</a>
        infrastructure team.

        Send me an <a href="mailto: lin1577@purdue.edu" >email</a> if you want a copy of my resume. You are most likely a 
        stalker or a friend, so the chances you do are slim. Serious inquiries only.
