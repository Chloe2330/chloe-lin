    <h1>Hello, I'm Chloe.</h1>
    <small>Student | Amateur Programmer</small>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a student at Purdue University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in security.
        I am also pursuing a math minor, a choice that I find myself questioning almost everyday. 
    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I code sometimes.
    </p>
    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
        If you scrolled all the way down here, maybe you are interested in some random
        facts about me. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I love all things basketball, and am an avid fan of the Golden State Warriors. Fortunately, 
        my life has aligned with one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history, so I would much 
        prefer the label "lucky fan", rather than bandwagon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I am from Fremont, California, a city in the East Bay region of the Bay Area, I 
        was born in Akron, Ohio. I have no memories of my early first stint in the midwest, so 
        I suffered through my first Indiana winter during freshman year of college like every other
        Californian.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not a collector, but I do occassionally fixate on things I would like to collect. 
        My current fixation is on Lego BrickHeadz, a line of collectible brick-built figures.
        At the moment, I only have three, and while I will continue to monitor new releases every month, 
        I don't have much intention expanding my small collection in the near future. 
        Some might call it restraint, others might use the term "window shopping".
